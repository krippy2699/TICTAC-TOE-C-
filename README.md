# TIC-TAC TOE (C++)
My rendition on the game of TIC-TAC-TOE. A simple algorithmic implementation of the game. The program uses a set of 6 functions, namely ->
1. display_game_board - **used to display the game cube **
2. get_empty - **used to check whether a current position entered by the user is valid. Passes 2 parameters. **
3. insert_TICTAC - **Used to insert the the tic and the tac in the grid. **
4. p1_check_win - **Player1 will always be X , therefore, this function checks if X/P1 won. **
5. p2_check_win - **Player2 will always be 0, therefore, this function is to check whether 0/p2 won. **
6.main() - **Finally, the driver used to call all these functions mentioned above.

The game may have some errors in terms of logic. I'll keep working on it. **TRY IT ! LETS HAVE FUN !**
